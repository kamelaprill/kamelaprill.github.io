   <h1>My Plans for the future</h1>
   
   <article>
     
     <p> In the future, I hope to be a successful Peditrician. I chose this career choice because most children don't have the ability to help themselves. So I want to be able to help them through medicine. <p>

       <li> I also want to implement coding for pediatrics. This will help conclude more accurate bills for the patients, reduce payment issues, and maximize profibility.
